It's been quite a while and I absolutely abondoned this blog. Ahh, so many things, so many changes...

Honestly, I have no idea how can I tell you all the changes in my life, so I'll skip that part and tell you how I revived this project.

Of course I didn't expecting this thing to work as it is, so it wasn't really suprise for me. And proved myself it is terrible idea to not using versioned docker tags or gems. :)

Basically, after initial failure, I removed Gemfile and lock files and created a new project in another folder and copied those files to here.

It's not much. But it was the first step, isn't it? I have plans for this blog and about my life. Decided to write here more often and hopefully (fingers crossed) I'll commit to it.

Until next time.
