My name is Yiğit and I am a NestJS and Ruby on Rails developer.
I also interested in Docker-Swarm, GraphQL and React.

You can contact me via [my LinkedIn account](www.linkedin.com/in/yiğit-sadıç-25563aa6).


I usually write posts in Turkish and English, but vous pouvez trouver des posts en français.

I named this blog after a painting of Fikret Mualla named "Kaz" of a white goose.
You can find this painting below:
