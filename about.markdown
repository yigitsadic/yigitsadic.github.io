Hello, this is Yigit ðŸ––

I'm a backend developer who's always looking to learn and improve.

With TypeScript I'm used to utilize and learn Golang, Ruby, Rail, Docker and Nodejs, and others like gRPC. When it comes to my personality, I am interested, open to learning new things about the tools and technology I use and willing to explore.

Playing with React and GraphQL helps me relax and unwind.

Sauf de l'anglais et de ma langue maternelle je peux aussi parler franÃ§ais.

You can contact me via [my LinkedIn account](www.linkedin.com/in/yiÄŸit-sadÄ±Ã§-25563aa6).

I usually write posts in Turkish and English, but vous pouvez trouver des posts en franÃ§ais.

I named this blog after a painting of Fikret Mualla named "Kaz" of a white goose.
You can find this painting below:
