Hello, this is Yigit ðŸ––

I'm a backend developer who's always looking to learn and improve.

I use Golang, Ruby on Rails, Docker and Nodejs with TypeScript and eager to use & learn more deeply them and other technologies such as gRPC. By personality, I am curious and open to learn and make experiments with the tools and technologies that I am using.

Playing with React and GraphQL helps me relax and unwind.

Sauf de l'anglais et de ma langue maternelle je peux aussi parler franÃ§ais.

You can contact me via [my LinkedIn account](www.linkedin.com/in/yiÄŸit-sadÄ±Ã§-25563aa6).

I usually write posts in Turkish and English, mais vous pouvez aussi trouver des posts en franÃ§ais.

I named this blog after a painting of Fikret Mualla named "Kaz" of a white goose.
You can find this painting below:
